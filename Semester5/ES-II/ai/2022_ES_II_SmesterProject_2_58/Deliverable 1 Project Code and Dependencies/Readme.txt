pip install opencv-python mediapipe ultralytics
You Need to install Python between 3.8 and 3.9 then run this 
To run your code, you'll need the following DLL files:
1.	OpenCV: Ensure you have the OpenCV DLLs, which are typically included when you install OpenCV via pip (pip install opencv-python). These include:
â€¢	opencv_worldXXX.dll (where XXX is the version number, e.g., opencv_world460.dll for OpenCV 4.6.0).
2.	MediaPipe: MediaPipe doesn't require separate DLL files as it is a pure Python package. Installing it via pip (pip install mediapipe) should suffice.
3.	YOLO (Ultralytics): YOLO models from Ultralytics also don't require separate DLL files. Installing the ultralytics package via pip (pip install ultralytics) will handle the necessary dependencies.
Make sure you have the following packages installed:
pip install opencv-python mediapipe ultralytics
